                <p>Nubra (Tibetan : ལྡུམ་ར; Wylie : ldum ra; English : Nubra) is a tri-armed valley located to the
                
                north east of Ladakh valley. Diskit, the headquarter of eponymous Subdivision and also of
                
                Nubra tehsil, is about 150 km north from Leh town, the capital of Ladakh, in Indian-
                
                administered Kashmir. Local scholars say that its original name was Ldumra (the valley of
                
                flowers). The Shyok River meets the Nubra or Siachan River to form a large valley that
                
                separates the Ladakh and Karakoram Ranges. The Shyok river is a tributary of the Indus river.
                
                The average altitude of the valley is about 10,000 ft. i.e. 3048 metres above the sea level.
                
                The common way to access this valley is to travel over the Khardung La pass from Leh town.
                
                Foreign nationals are required to get a Protected area permit to visit the Nubra Valley.
                
                Since 1 April 2017 Indian citizens are also required to get an Inner Line Permit to visit the
                
                valley.</p>

                <p>Like the rest of the Tibetan Plateau, Nubra is a high altitude cold desert with rare
                
                precipitation and scant vegetation except along river beds. The villages are irrigated and
                
                fertile, producing wheat, barley, peas, mustard and a variety of fruits and nuts, including
                
                blood apples, walnuts, apricots and even a few almond trees. Most of the Nubra Valley is
                
                inhabited by Nubra dialect or Nubra Skat speakers. The majority are Buddhists. In the western
                
                or lowest altitude end of Nubra Valley near the Line of Control i.e. the Indo-Pak border,
                
                along the Shyok River, the inhabitants are Balti of Gilgit-Baltistan, who speak Balti, and
                
                are Shia and Sufia Nurbakhshia Muslims.
                
                Siachen Glacier lies to the north of the valley. The Sasser Pass and the famous Karakoram
                
                Pass lie to the northwest of the valley and connect Nubra with Uyghur (Mandarin : Xinjiang).
                
                Previously there was much trade passing through the area with western China's Xinjiang and
                
                Central Asia. The people of Baltistan also used the Nubra valley for passage to Tibet.[2]</p>
