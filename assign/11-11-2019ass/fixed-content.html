                <p>Technology is one of our favourite topics at the moment. This is because the use of technology can enrich the experiences of both learning and teaching English. Along with a team of experts, we’ve discussed this is detail in our Blended Teaching series of blogs – and we’ve also compiled a useful list of the best technology available to English language learners.</P>
                <p>Inspired by this, we set about putting together a list of the best technology and futuristic novels for English learners. Reading novels is one of the most fun and effective ways of improving your English language skills. It can expand your vocabulary and expose you to different sentence structures, as well as give you the chance enjoy some wonderful stories.</p>     
                <p>E-readers and tablets make learning English even easier because if you don’t know a word, you can simply click on it to read its definition. On a Kindle you can even add new words you’ve learnt to its Vocabulary Builder feature. Others recommend listening to and reading text at the same time as an excellent way of enhancing the learning process. Kindle’s Whispersync for Voice is designed for just this purpose and includes audio with selected books, meaning you can listen and follow the text as you read.</p>
