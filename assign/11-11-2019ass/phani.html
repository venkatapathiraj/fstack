                <p>superstitions related to widowhood and subversive condition of women were common in
                        Bengal and whole of the India. Tagore, however was progressive in his approach towards
                        eliminating age- old practices and superstitions of the society which stood in front of the
                        progress of the half- population, i.e. women. As a matter of fact what is most interesting about
                        Chokher Bali is that Tagore envisioned such a strong and potent character like Binodini at his
                        time when it might not have been thought even in the wildest of dreams that a woman can be
                        this much upright and confident. The way Tagore has presented kaleidoscopic vision of human
                        relationships which are intricately woven inside the chambers of a common household is a
                        bigger achievement than anything else.
                        Chokher Bali narrates the story of a wealthy jamindar family of Kolkata. The house is
                        maintained by Rajlakshmi, the widowed wife of a well- established jamindar. Mahendra, the
                        male protagonist of the novel is Rajlakshmi’s only issue, thus is an apple of her eye. Mahendra
                        has lived a life of comfort with nothing to worry about, from responsibilities of house to that
                        of the world because he is a much pampered and much cared for son of his mother. Mahendra,
                        is the sole inheritor of property as well as of his mother’s love. In the beginning of the novel
                        Mahendra is shown as a true child of his mother, showing plenty of affection and dedication
                        towards his mother. He does not agree to get married because he thinks this would create a gap
                        between him and his mother. Rajlakshmi though pretends to be worried about her son’s
                        dismissal of marriage proposals, but she remains inwardly happy to see that her son is so
                        concerned for her. After turning down so many proposals, Mahendra gets ready to see a girl,
                        even that for his friend Behari and not for himself, and eventually falls in love with the girl.
                        Mahendra, ironically decides to get married against the wish of his mother. It is truly conflicting
                        to see that Mahendra, the mum’s boy, goes against the will of his mother, for whom he once
                        refused to get married, in order to marry the girl of his own choice. Mahendra’s dedication for
                        his mother vanishes as soon as he feels romantic about Ashalata, thus his defiant nature is
                        revealed, much to the astonishment of the readers, as soon as the novel begins. Ashalata enters
                        Mahendra’s household as a bride, a coy and hesitant orphan girl who had been brought up by
                        her uncle. Absence of mother’s guidance, love and care and lack of authority into other’s
                        household had turned her into an inept and timid person, unsure about everything around her.
                        After getting married to Mahendra, she again suffers that loss of maternal love and guidance
                        because Rajlaksmi didn’t like her as she thought that Annapurna, her widowed and issueless
                        sister-in-law cunningly brought Asha in the house as a bride so that she could take complete
                        hold over Mahendra and Asha both, because Asha was Annapurna’s niece.
                        As soon as Mahendra marries Asha, he gets completely engrossed in thinking about Asha all
                        the times, and their romance starts blooming up to the fullest. The new found attraction of a
                        recently engendered love takes complete hold of Mahendra’s senses and he forgets everything
                        and everyone around him instead of Asha. Need of physical proximity almost maddened him
                        as he could not tolerate that his mother engaged Asha into household works all the times. He
                        craved for Asha’s presence and thus he plotted a scheme that Asha should learn reading. It was,
                        however, only an excuse to keep Asha near him. Mahendra’s authoritative decision regarding
                        Asha’s studies and her removal from hosehold chores deeply offended his mother who could
                        not tolerate that her son stood in front of her for his wife’s sake. Asha felt delighted to see that
                        her husband did not spare any chance of being with her, and cared for her so much.</p>
